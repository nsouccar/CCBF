For theÂ New York Times,Â Wall Street Journal, and several other national media outlets, Bailey frequently contributes his real estate expertise and advice. As an owner of several properties and father of two children, Bailey was inspired â and uniquely placed â to write about homes in a way that is relatable to real estate professionals, first-time home buyers, and young minds. In 2017, he was also named Humanitarian of the Year by a local high school for his charitable efforts. A lifetime believer in giving back to the community, 100% of the proceeds from his latest childrenâs book,Â Home, will go to the Building Foundations and Dreams, the charity he founded that strives to assist underserved students of all ages in pursuing their dreams. To-date,Â HomeÂ has won a number of awards, including the Literary Classics International Book Award, the Momâs Choice Award, and the eLit Book Award. Baileyâs first book, a guide for first-time homebuyers entitledÂ Finding the Uncommon Deal, was also aÂ New York TimesÂ Bestseller and winner of the National Association of Real Estate Editors âBest First Time Author Award.â", "Tracey Baptiste is the author of the highly acclaimed middle grade fantasy sensations, The Jumbies and Rise of the Jumbies. Sheâs also the author of the young adult novel, Angelâs Grace as well as numerous non-fiction books. Her newest middle grade novel is the wildly popular, Minecraft: The Crash. As a little girl growing up in Trinidad, Tracey loved books. When she was three, her mother bought her an oversized, illustrated copy of Grimmâs Fairy Tales, and from that moment on, she knew she wanted to be a writer. Tracey once started her very own library in her houseâ¦ and secretly hoped everyone would bring their books back late so she could collect fines and become rich. As an eleven-year-old, she was inspired by V. S. Naipaulâs Miguel Street, and read the book so many times, her brotherâs hand-me-down copy disintegrated. And after moving to the United States when she was fifteen, she read Rosa Guyâs The Friends, and thatâs when she knew she wanted to write for kids. Tracey attended New York University where she earned a Bachelorâs degree in English and Comparative Literature as well as a Masterâs degree in Elementary Education. She taught elementary school for many years â second grade was her favorite â and is currently a member of the faculty at Lesley Universityâs Creative Writing MFA program. Tracey also volunteers with the grassroots, non-profit organizations, We Need Diverse Books, The Brown Bookshelf, and I, Too, Arts Collective. These days, Tracey lives with her husband and kids in New Jersey.

After college, I craved adventure and maybe a little glamour too, so I moved to Los Angeles and learned how to write for film and television. While I was waiting for the proverbial big break, I worked at temp jobs, a film studio, and a celebrity publicity firm before going it freelance as an advertising copywriter. Eventually I taught myself HTML and how to make stuff for the then-brand-new Internet thing, and started running the website for the PBS teen documentary series âIn the Mix.â I enjoyed working in interactive media, which was a lot more rewarding than writing movie scripts that would never get made. I was fortunate to receive a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to create a website called Itâs My Life, which would be a safe place on PBS Kids for young people ages 9 to 13 to explore topics like dealing with divorce, bullying, puberty, and depression. Itâs My Life became an amazing community, and I loved writing about all the things that are important to tweens. Somewhere in there, I started a novel. Going back to fiction was like finding a key Iâd lost at the bottom of a junk drawer. Realizing that I wanted to write for young adults was like finding the hidden door that key opened.
